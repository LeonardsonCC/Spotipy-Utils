# My rofi Spotify

## The application
In this moment, all that it does is just add the current playing music in the playlist you choose, but I'll add play/pause controls, etc.

## Install

- Install the dependencies of project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Configure your Spotify application credentials, that you can obtain by [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), in the ```config.ini``` file, wich have an example in ```config.ini.example```.

- Run the script once to connect your account.

- Everything should be ok! (Maybe there's some problems with the authentication, but I'm trying to solve).
